Key Objectives:

Determine which countries are most indebted globally.

Compare reliance on bilateral vs. multilateral debt by country.

Identify countries with the most diverse types of debt.

Quantify the proportion of global debt concentrated among top debtors.

Explore which indicator codes contribute most to global debt.

Evaluate average debt per debt type by country.

Visualize findings through interactive Tableau dashboards.
